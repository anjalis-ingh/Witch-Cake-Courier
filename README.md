# Witch Cake Courier

This is a 2D side-scrolling delivery game made in Processing (Java mode). You play as a small witch flying on her broomstick, delivering cakes to houses before time runs out.

Each house has a floating cake sign showing what kind it wants. Drop the correct cake as you fly over to earn points and move to the next level. Your goal is to complete all deliveries before the timer reaches zero.

# How to Play
### Controls
Use the arrow keys to fly up, down, left, and right
Click a cake icon (top-right) to drop that cake or press 1, 2, or 3 to drop a specific cake
R = Restart the game at any time

### Gameplay
There are 3 levels, and each level shows a timer and remaining orders in the top-left corner.
Houses appear as you fly, and each displays a cake icon above its roof, showing what it wants.
Fly directly above a house and drop the matching cake to deliver it.
You earn points for correct deliveries and a bonus for leftover time when finishing a level.
Once a house receives its cake, its sign turns green, and it will not accept any more deliveries.
Deliver all cakes before time runs out to advance to the next level.
If the timer hits zero before completing all orders, you lose the round.
